		1. Name: Julianne Marie Ruz<br>

		2. Nickname: Jules<br>

		3. Favorite CMSC subject: CMSC 124. Wish they'd taught us this sooner because it helped me understand the programming languages that I use and how to use them better.<br>

		4. Favorite GE: HUM 1. Madali lang magbasa at tuwing may film showing sa klase may libre akong tulog.<br>

		5. Favorite PL: Java. I have more control over the parts of the program and GUI programming here's challenging enough for a hobby.<br>

		6. Favorite food: <s>may inaayawan ba ako na pagkain hmm</s>Sinigang. Asim kilig is the best kilig.<br>
		</p><br>

		<p>
		Hobbies: sleeping, drawing, coding, not necessarily in that order or all at once. <br>

		What was your childhood dream: I remember wanting to be an artist mostly.
