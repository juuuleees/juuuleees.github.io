					1. Name: Julianne Marie Ruz<br>	<br>
		
					2. Nickname: Jules<br><br>	
		
					3. Favorite CMSC subject: CMSC 124. Wish they'd taught us this sooner because it helped me understand the 		programming languages that I use and how to use them better.<br><br>	
		
					4. Favorite GE: HUM 1. Madali lang magbasa at tuwing may film showing sa klase may libre akong tulog.<br><br>
		
					5. Favorite PL: Java. I have more control over the parts of the program and GUI programming here's challenging enough for a hobby.<br><br>
		
					6. Favorite food: <s>may inaayawan ba ako na pagkain hmm</s> Sinigang. Asim kilig is the best kilig.<br><br>	

					Hobbies: sleeping, drawing, coding, socially drinking, not necessarily in that order or all at once. <br><br>
			
					What was your childhood dream: I remember wanting to be an artist mostly.
